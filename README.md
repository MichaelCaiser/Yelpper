<b>Search results page<b><br>
<br>
Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height<br>
Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints<br>
Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).<br>
Optional: infinite scroll for restaurant results <br>

</b>Filter page<b><br><br>
The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).<br>
The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.<br>
You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. <br>
Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app <br>
Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. <br> 
Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search <br>
